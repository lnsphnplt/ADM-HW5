Group 5 of ADM homework number 5.

In the main.ipynb you can find all the functionality and visualization requested in the homework text.
In the other files there are each functionality and the Data Cleaning. Command line question is in a separate file as requested.

The main notebook can also be viewed [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/lnsphnplt/ADM-HW5/blob/main/main.ipynb).

We worked with the [Marvel Network Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/csanhueza/the-marvel-universe-social-network?select=hero-network.csv).
